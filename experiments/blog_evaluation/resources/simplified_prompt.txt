# Blog Comparison and Evaluation Task

## Task Overview
Given the pdf document, you will compare and evaluate two blog posts (Blog A and Blog B) that both summarize it. Your goal is to determine which blog better represents the original research across three key dimensions: helpfulness, comprehensiveness, and factual grounding.

## Input Materials
<blog_a_text>{{blog_a_text}}</blog_a_text>
<blog_b_text>{{blog_b_text}}</blog_b_text>

## Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. HELPFULNESS
Determine which blog is more helpful for readers trying to understand the research paper.

<helpfulness_criteria>
- **Clarity & Accessibility**: Which blog explains complex concepts more clearly?
- **Practical Value**: Which blog better explains why the research matters?
- **Educational Value**: Which blog teaches concepts more effectively?
- **Reader Engagement**: Which blog is more engaging and easier to follow?
</helpfulness_criteria>

### 2. COMPREHENSIVENESS
Determine which blog provides more comprehensive coverage of the original research paper.

<comprehensiveness_criteria>
- **Key Research Elements**: Which blog better covers research questions, methodology, findings, and conclusions?
- **Important Details**: Which blog includes more essential technical details and context?
- **Completeness**: Which blog represents the paper more completely?
- **Balance**: Which blog better prioritizes important vs. peripheral information?
</comprehensiveness_criteria>

<comprehensiveness_indicators>
- Coverage of methodology and approach
- Inclusion of key findings and results
- Discussion of limitations and implications
- Appropriate level of detail for blog format
- Balance between sections
</comprehensiveness_indicators>

### 3. FACTUAL GROUNDING
Determine which blog is more factually accurate and better grounded in the original paper.

<factual_grounding_criteria>
- **Factual Accuracy**: Which blog has fewer factual errors or misstatements?
- **Faithful Representation**: Which blog more faithfully represents the authors' findings and conclusions?
- **No Hallucination**: Which blog avoids unsupported claims or exaggerations?
- **Appropriate Uncertainty**: Which blog better communicates the certainty/uncertainty of findings?
</factual_grounding_criteria>

<critical_issues>
- Factual errors or misstatements
- Claims not supported by the paper
- Misrepresentation of limitations
- Overgeneralization of findings
- Incorrect data or statistics
</critical_issues>

## Evaluation Scale
For each dimension, use this comparison scale:
- **Blog A significantly better**: Clear advantage in multiple areas
- **Blog A slightly better**: Minor advantage overall
- **TIE**: Both blogs are roughly equal
- **Blog B slightly better**: Minor advantage overall
- **Blog B significantly better**: Clear advantage in multiple areas

## Instructions
1. First, carefully read the original research paper to understand its content, methodology, findings, and conclusions.
2. Read both Blog A and Blog B completely.
3. For each dimension (helpfulness, comprehensiveness, factual grounding):
   - Compare the blogs using the specific criteria provided
   - Identify concrete examples that support your evaluation
   - Determine a winner with a confidence level and margin
   - Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
4. Format your evaluation for each dimension according to the output format below
