  # Academic Document Retrieval System

  ## Task Objective
  Your task is to analyze a collection of academic papers and identify the 5 most relevant documents that would best help answer a given research question.

  ## Input Data
  <documents>
  {documents_text}
  </documents>

  <query>
  {query}
  </query>

  ## Detailed Instructions
  1. Carefully read and understand the research question in the <query> section.
  2. Analyze each academic document in the collection, paying attention to:
    - Relevance of the document's main topic to the query
    - Presence of specific information that directly addresses the question
    - Quality and depth of information related to the query
    - Recency and authority of the research (if applicable)
  3. Rank the documents based on their relevance to the query.
  4. Select the top 5 most relevant documents.

  ## Selection Criteria
  - Prioritize documents that directly address the specific aspects mentioned in the query
  - Consider documents with experimental evidence or empirical data related to the query
  - Include documents that provide comprehensive background information if relevant
  - Select documents that complement each other to provide a well-rounded answer

  ## Response Format
  Return ONLY the document IDs of the 5 most relevant documents, with one document ID per line, enclosed in <Documents></Documents> tags. Do not include any explanations, justifications, or additional text.

  Example response format:
  <Documents>
  doc_id_1
  doc_id_2
  doc_id_3
  doc_id_4
  doc_id_5
  </Documents>

  Provide your final list of the 5 most relevant document IDs without any preamble or additional explanations.

  # Academic Document Retrieval System (Interest Alignment Mode)

  ## Task Objective
  Act as a **Research Scout** for a senior researcher. Your goal is to curate a reading list of 5 documents that best satisfy the user's stated **Research Interests**. You are looking for high-value signal, not just keyword matches.

  ## Input Data
  <documents>
  {documents_text}
  </documents>

  <interest_profile>
  {user_interest_description}
  </interest_profile>

  ## Detailed Instructions
  1.  **Analyze the Interest Profile:**
      * Identify the core topics (e.g., "Long-text input," "Benchmarks," "Evaluation").
      * Identify the target utility (e.g., "Assessing capabilities," "Handling lengthy documents").
      * *Crucial:* Understand that the user is looking for *tools, methods, and evidence*, not just definitions.

  2.  **Evaluate Each Document (The "Scout" Logic):**
      * **Direct Alignment:** Does this paper present a benchmark, a dataset, or a rigorous evaluation method for the specific topics in the profile?
      * **Methodological Depth:** Is the paper purely theoretical, or does it offer empirical results (tables, charts, comparisons) relevant to the interest?
      * **Authority Signal:** Is this from a key player in this specific niche (e.g., DeepMind, Anthropic, Stanford CRFM) or a top-tier venue (NeurIPS, ICLR)?

  3.  **Selection Strategy (The "3-Tier Mix"):**
      * **Tier 1: The Core Matches (3 docs):** Papers that are explicitly about the intersection of the user's interests (e.g., "A new benchmark for 100k+ token context").
      * **Tier 2: The High-Authority Broaden (1 doc):** A seminal paper from a famous lab that might be slightly broader but defines the field (e.g., a major survey on LLM evaluations).
      * **Tier 3: The Novelty/Wildcard (1 doc):** A paper applying these concepts in a unique way (e.g., "Using long-context LLMs for legal contract analysis") to spark new ideas.

  ## Ranking Logic
  Rank the top 5 documents. The list must prioritize **utility** to the researcher. A paper describing a *new benchmark* is more valuable than a paper simply *using* an old one.

  ## Response Format
  Return ONLY the document IDs of the 5 most relevant documents, with one document ID per line, enclosed in <Documents></Documents> tags.

  Example response format:
  <Documents>
  doc_id_1
  doc_id_2
  doc_id_3
  doc_id_4
  doc_id_5
  </Documents>
